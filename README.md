# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 5

There are two parts to your lab assignment, and each is in a different assignment in Canvas:

### First Part: In lab today

**Be sure to follow instructions carefully and meticulously.**

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* While you are in the process of writing and testing your code problems, every function should be called by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
* Create a new branch for each code problem, and merge each branch into *master* on GitHub (and then pull back into master on your laptops!) when the problem is completed. Do the problems in order. Don't forget to pull the updated master branch from GitHub into your local master branch ***each*** time, before creating the branch for the next problem. Steps for this process will be given at the bottom of this document.

### Second Part: Over the weekend

One of them is a weekend project: put finishing touches on your About Me project and get it deployed. This will be due at 11:59pm on Sunday evening. The more time you spend with this, the better you'll get at CSS styling, but keep in mind that you also have readings to do and need to get some rest and relaxation in as well! We have a HUGE week next week, so be sure to come into it refreshed and ready.

### HTML and JS setup: starter code!
You are being given starter code for today, in the index.html and app.js files inside of this directory. The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in tests.js file. You do not need to do anything with tests.js, though you should take a look at it to see how it works.

Submission instructions are in the Canvas assignment as usual.

## When you start working on a new problem...
* Start from an up-to-date **master** branch by making certain that you've done a `git checkout master` and then a `git pull origin master` to sync the local repository with the version on GitHub
*  Create a new feature branch with `git checkout -b <branchname>`  
* Do work on your feature branch to solve the problem, and then **add**, **commit**, and **push** (ACP FTW!)  
 * `git add .`  
 * `git commit -m <useful message in quotes>`   
 * `git push origin <feature_branch_name>`
* On GitHub...
 * Create a Pull Request (PR) for that branch on GitHub
 * Have your partner review the code in the PR and merge it into master
 * Both members of the team then need to `git checkout master` and then a `git pull origin master` to sync the local repository with the version on GitHub
